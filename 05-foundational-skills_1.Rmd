# Getting Started with R and RStudio {#c05}

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is designed to take you from installing R and RStudio all the way through the very basics of data loading and manipulation using the {tidyverse} [@wickham2019]. 

We will be covering the following topics in this chapter: 

- Installing R and RStudio
- RStudio environment, layout, and customization
- How to run code in R
- Installing the {dataedu} package
- Help documentation
- Steps for working through new and unfamiliar content
- Getting started with {swirl}

## Downloading R and RStudio

First, you will need to download the latest versions of R [@rcoreteam] and RStudio [@rstudio]. 
R is a free environment for statistical computing and graphics using the programming language R. 
RStudio is a set of integrated tools that allows for a more user-friendly experience for using R.

Although you will likely use RStudio as your main console and editor, _you must first install R_, as RStudio uses R behind-the-scenes.  
Both R and RStudio are freely-available, cross-platform, and open-source.

### To download R:

- Visit this page to download R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

Don't worry; you will not mess anything up if you download (or even install!) the wrong file. 
Once you've installed R, you can get started.

### To download RStudio:

- Visit this page to download RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Under the column called "RStudio Desktop FREE", click Download
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

If you do have issues, consider this [page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), and then reach out for help. 
Another excellent place to get help is the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

## RStudio layout and customization: getting to know R through RStudio

Now that we've installed both R and RStudio, we will be accessing R _through_ RStudio. 
One of the most reliable ways to tell if you're opening R or RStudio is to look at the icons: 

<center>
![R and RStudio icons](./man/figures/icons.png)
</center>

RStudio is an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE), and comes with built-in features that make using R a little easier. 
If you'd like more information on the difference between R and RStudio, we recommend the **Getting Started** section of the [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#) @statisticalinf textbook.

You do not _have_ to use RStudio to access R, and many people don't! 

Other IDEs that work with R include:

- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/)
- [VIM](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-for-intellij)
- [EMACS Speaks Statistics (ESS)](https://ess.r-project.org/)

This is a non-exhaustive list, and most of these options require a good deal of familiarity with a given IDE.
However we bring up alternative IDEs -- particularly ESS -- because RStudio, as of this writing, is not fully accessible for learners who utilize screen readers.
We have chosen to use RStudio in this text in order to standardize the experience, but encourage you to choose the IDE that best suits your needs!

**RStudio layout** 

When we open RStudio for the first time, we're should see something similar to this:

<center>
![RStudio layout](./man/figures/rstudio_three_pane.png)
</center>
  
These three "panes" are referred to as the **console** pane, the **environment** pane, and the **files** pane. 
The large square on the left is the **console** pane, the square in the top right is the **environment** pane, and the square in the bottom right is the **files** pane.  

As you work with R more, you'll find yourself using the tabs within each of the panes.

When we create a new file, such as an R script, an R Markdown file, or a Shiny app, RStudio will open a fourth pane, known as the **source** pane.  
The source pane should show up as a square in the top left.
Go ahead and complete the following steps to open up an `.R` script in the source pane:

In this book we'll primarily be working with `.R` files, which we also refer to as "R scripts."
You can try this out by going to `File -> New File -> R Script`.  
You do not need to do anything specific with this file, but are welcome to experiment with it if you would like!  
**Customizing RStudio**  

- Explore the various themes available to you in RStudio by going to _Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance_
    + Choose a theme that works best for you and apply it  

### Writing and Running Code in R

In order to run code in R you need to type your code either in the Console or within an `.R` script.  

For the purposes of this chapter we recommend creating an `.R` script to type all of your code because you can add comments and then save your `.R` script for reference, whereas anything that you type in the Console will disappear as soon as you restart or close R.  

To run code in the Console, you type your code and hit 'Enter'.  
Go ahead and try this by...

There are three ways to run code in an `.R` script:  
- Highlight the line(s) of code you'd like to run and press **Ctrl + Enter**  
- Highlight the line(s) of code you'd like to run and click the **Run** button in the `R script` pane  
- To run _every_ line of code in your file you can press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**

### Commenting Your Code in R

It is considered good practice to comment your code when working in an `.R` script. 
Even if you are the only person to ever work on your code, it can be helpful to write yourself notes about what you were trying to do with a specific piece of code. 
Comments in R are how we accomplish that!
Comments are ignored by R when running a script, so they will not affect your code or analysis. 

To comment out a line of code, you can place a pound sign (`#`) in front of the line of code.
If you think you'll be writing more than one line of code, you can do a pound sign followed by a single quotation mark (`#'`). 
This will continue to comment out lines of text or code each time you hit "Enter."
You can delete the `#'` on a new line where you want to write code for R to run.

You can also use `#` to comment out lines of code.
Be careful when doing this, especially in longer files, as it can be easy to forget where you've commented out code. 
It is often better to simply start a new section of code to tinker with until you get it working as expected, rather than commenting out lines of code.

_Note: when we refer to "commenting" we're referring to adding in actual text comments, whereas "commenting out" refers to using the pound sign in front of a line of code so that R ignores it._
_We will also use the phrase "uncomment code," which means you should delete (or omit when typing out) the `#` or `#'` sign in an example._
    
## Using the dataedu package to access the data used in this book

We created the {dataedu} package to provide our readers an opportunity to jump into R however they see fit.

The package serves three main functions:

1. Mass installation of all the packages used in the book
2. Reproducible code for the walkthroughs
3. Access to the data used in each of the walkthroughs  

Because we've just covered how to run code, go ahead and install the {dataedu} package by running the code below.
If you would like more information about what's happening in this code before you run anything on your computer, that's OK! 
We'll go over installing, loading, and exploring the {dataedu} package in more depth in Chapter 6.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install devtools
install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

# install the dataedu package
devtools::install_github("data-edu/dataedu")
```

## Exploring R quickly with {swirl}

If you were able to install the {dataedu} package without any issues or concerns, and you're eager to get started exploring everything that R can do, we recommend installing and learning through [{swirl}](https://swirlstats.com/students.html).  
You can install swirl by running the following code:  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
```

{swirl} is set of packages (more on those in Chapter 6!) that you can download, providing an interactive method for learning R by using R in the console.  
You can follow the instructions on the {swirl} webpage (you've already installed R, RStudio, and the {swirl} package), or run the following code _in your console pane_ to get started with a beginner-level course in {swirl}:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(swirl)
install_course("R_Programming_E")
swirl()
```

There are multiple courses available on {swirl}, and you can access them by installing them and then running the `swirl()` command in your console.
We are not affiliated with {swirl} in any way, nor is it required to use {swirl} in order to progress through this text, but it's a great resource that we want to make sure that you're aware of!
