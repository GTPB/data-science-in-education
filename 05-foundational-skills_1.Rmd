# Getting Started with R and RStudio {#c05}

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is designed to take you from installing R and RStudio all the way through the very basics of data loading and manipulation using the {tidyverse} [@wickham2019]. 

We will be covering the following topics in this chapter: 

- Installing R and RStudio
- RStudio environment and pane layout
- Basics of customizing your RStudio environment
- Steps for working through new and unfamiliar content
- Accessing the data sets used in this book

First, you will need to download the latest versions of R [@rcoreteam] and RStudio [@rstudio]. 
R is a free environment for statistical computing and graphics using the programming language R. 
RStudio is a set of integrated tools that allows for a more user-friendly experience for using R.

Although you will likely use RStudio as your main console and editor, _you must first install R_, as RStudio uses R behind-the-scenes. 
Both R and RStudio are freely-available, cross-platform, and open-source.

## Downloading R and RStudio

### To download R:

- Visit this page to download R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

Don't worry; you will not mess anything up if you download (or even install!) the wrong file. 
Once you've installed R, you can get started.

### To download RStudio:

- Visit this page to download RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Under the column called "RStudio Desktop FREE", click Download
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

If you do have issues, consider this [page](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), and then reach out for help. 
Another excellent place to get help is the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

## Getting to know R through RStudio

Now that we've installed both R and RStudio, we will be accessing R _through_ RStudio. 
One of the most reliable ways to tell if you're opening R or RStudio is to look at the icons: 

<center>
![](./man/figures/icons.png)
</center>

RStudio is an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE), and comes with built-in features that make using R a little easier. 
If you'd like more information on the difference between R and RStudio, we recommend the **Getting Started** section of the [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#) @statisticalinf textbook.

You do not _have_ to use RStudio to access R, and many people don't! 

Other IDEs that work with R include:

- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/)
- [VIM](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-for-intellij)
- [EMACS Speaks Statistics (ESS)](https://ess.r-project.org/)

This is a non-exhaustive list, and most of these options require a good deal of familiarity with a given IDE.
However we bring up alternative IDEs -- particularly ESS -- because RStudio, as of this writing, is not fully accessible for learners who utilize screen readers.
We have chosen to use RStudio in this text in order to standardize the experience, but encourage you to choose the IDE that best suits your needs!

When we open RStudio for the first time, we're likely to see this:

<center>
![](https://i.imgur.com/2rhZmMg.png?1)
</center>  
  
These three "panes" are referred to as the **console** pane, the **environment** pane, and the **files** pane. 
The large square on the left is the **console**, the pane in the top right is the **environment** pane, and the square in the bottom right is the **files** pane.  

When we create a new file, such as an `R script`, an `R Markdown` file, or a `Shiny app`, RStudio will open a fourth pane, known as the **source** pane. 
You can try this out by going to `File -> New File -> R Script`.

When we type out code, we do so in either the **console** or **source** pane. 
It is generally better to type code in an `R script`, which saves as an `.R` file, than to type your code in the console. 
This is because anything you type in the console will be lost as soon as you close R, whereas you can save everything in an `.R` script and see/use it again later.  

**Running code in an R Script**  

There are several ways to run code in an R script:  

- Highlight the line(s) of code you'd like to run and press **Ctrl + Enter**  
- Highlight the line(s) of code you'd like to run and click the **Run** button in the `R script` pane  
- To run _every_ line of code in your file you can press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**  

**Creating and running code in an R Markdown file**

R Markdown is a highly convenient way to communicate and share results. Navigate to "New File" and then "R Markdown".

Then, click "Knit to PDF", "Knit to HTML", or "Knit to Word".

**Changing your RStudio theme**  

- Explore the various themes available to you in RStudio by going to _Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance_
    + Choose a theme that works best for you and apply it
    
## Using the dataedu package to access the data used in this book

We created the {dataedu} package to provide our readers an opportunity to jump into R however they see fit.

We describe how to install the package in the next chapter. The package serves four functions:

1. Mass installation of all the packages used in the book
2. Reproducible code for the walkthroughs
3. Access to the data used in each of the walkthroughs

### Mass Installation of Packages

We strived to use packages that we use in our daily work when creating the walkthroughs in the book. Because we covered a variety of subjects, that means we used a lot of packages! As described in the Foundational Skills chapter, you can install the packages individually as they suit your needs. 

However, if you want to quickly get started and download all the packages at once, please use `install_dataedu()`.

``` r
dataedu::install_dataedu()
```

To see the packages used in the book, run:

```{r}
dataedu::dataedu_packages
```

**A special note on {tabulizer}:** One of the walkthroughs uses [tabulizer](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer), created by ROpenSci to read PDFs. {tabulizer} requires the installation of [RJava](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html), which can be a tricky process on Mac computers. {tabulizer} is not included in `mass_install()` and we recommend reading through the notes on its Github repo if installing.

### Reproducible Code for Walkthroughs

<!-- Need to add -->

### Accessing the Walkthrough Data

You can call the dataset as mentioned in the walkthrough.

``` r
dataedu::course_data
```

## Steps for working through new and unfamiliar content

A sure sign of a great educator is the ability to ask questions. 
Asking the right questions at the right time of the learners in your classroom can facilitate understanding, uncover misconceptions, and indicate whether or not learners have mastered the material.

However, when youâ€™re learning on your own you have to simultaneously fill the roles of both learner and educator, and not only know both how and when to ask yourself questions, but also answer your questions, evaluate your answers, and redirect your learning path as you progress.

This section is intended to give you a series of steps you can use as you encounter new and unfamiliar content both in reading this book as well as in your broader data science learning endeavors.
For this section we'll use the example of encountering a function for the first time, but you can use these steps with any new piece of information that you encounter!
We'll cover functions in greater depth in subsequent chapters, but for now all you need to know about a function is that it's a reusable piece of code that allows us to consistently repeat a programming task. 

**Activate prior knowledge**
You've been reading through a tutorial and have come across the `coalesce()` function in the vignette for the [{janitor} function]("https://github.com/sfirke/janitor):

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

roster <- roster_raw %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) %>% 
    mutate(hire_date = excel_numeric_to_date(hire_date),
           cert = coalesce(certification, certification_1)) %>% 
    select(-certification, -certification_1)
```

_Note: you aren't expected to know what the chunk of code that you've just read does, but by the time you've finished this book you'll be able to run and understand everything in the code example!_

Take a moment to think through the following questions:

* What does the word "coalesce" mean?
* Have you ever seen the `coalesce()` function before? If so, in what context?

**Look for context clues**

* Read a couple of lines of code both above and below where the `coalesce()` function appears - are there any clues as to what this function might do?

**Check the docs**

* What information is available in the Help documentation?
* Are there any examples from the Help documentation that seem similar to what you're trying to accomplish? For example, this seems somewhat related to what we're trying to do:

![Example from the `coalesce()` Help documentation](images/coalesce_help_doc.png)

**Find the limits**
Work through examples in the Help documentation (or examples that you've found online) and test the limits.
Testing the limits is a way of understanding the code by seeing how it handles different situations.
Ultimately what you're doing is recognizing a pattern, developing a hypothesis, and testing whether or not that hypothesis is true.
Some methods for testing the limits include:

* Substituting obviously larger (or smaller values)
* Substituting different data types
* What happens if you introduce `NA` values?
* Is the order of values important?

**Test (and refine) your understanding**
Take a moment to think through whether or not you could explain what you've just learned to someone else.
Imagine the questions that they might ask of you, and try to answer them.
If you can't answer them, dig deeper into the documentation, online forums, or even in testing your own knowledge, until you feel like you can! 

You won't necessarily have the time (or interest!) in doing this for each new or unfamiliar piece of content that you come across, but we hope that this provides you with a starting framework for furthering your understanding when you _do_ come across content that you want to explore a bit more in-depth!
